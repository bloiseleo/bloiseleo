I am a Full-Stack Developer working mainly on Web projects. I've started to code in 2016 and got my first job at it on 2020. Since then, I've worked with the most popular programming languages and frameworks, such as php with laravel, javascript with angular and react, sql and so on. Nowadays, I am focusing my studies in Android and Development and System Analysis at Est√°cio. I also have worked with biology data manipulation, health insurance and producing softwares related to data manipulation.
